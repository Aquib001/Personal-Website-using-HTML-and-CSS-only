# Personal-Website-using-HTML-and-CSS-only
<H1>Hi There!</H1>
<p>This is my brand new personal site that I have created using HTML and CSS only basically for practicing my HTML and CSS skills.<br />
I have deployed this project on Netlify as it is significantly faster and stable than github pages.<p>
<h3>My Next Project will on Bootstrap and I will try to implement new styles and features for my upcoming projects.</h3>
<h2>Stay Tuned!!</h2>
